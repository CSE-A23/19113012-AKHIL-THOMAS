                                                         PART A
1) In C++ following operators can not be overloaded,
  . (Member Access or Dot operator)
  ?: (Ternary or Conditional Operator)
  :: (Scope Resolution Operator)
  .* (Pointer-to-member Operator)
  
2) Compiler Error in line ” Derived *dp = new Base;

3) Multipath Inheritance in C++ is derivation of a class from other derived classes, which are derived from the same base class.
This type of inheritance involves other inheritance likemultiple, multilevel, hierarchical.
The problem that arises when using multipath inheritance refers to a derived class having more than one parent class that 
defines property or methods with the same name. 
This conflict can be resolved by
i) The order in which the superclasses or parents are given define which property or method will be accessible by the 
conflict-causing name; the others will remain hidden.
ii) The subclass must resolve the problem by providing a property or method with the name, and by defining how to use the
ones from its parents, resolve the ambiguity with the class and a scope resolution operator.

4) A virtual function will become pure virtual function when you append "=0" at the end of declaration of virtual function. 
Pure virtual function doesn't have body or implementation. We must implement all pure virtual functions in derived class.
Pure virtual function is also known as abstract function.
A class is made abstract by declaring one or more of its virtual functions to be "pure".
i.e, by placing "= 0" in its declaration.

Syntax:
  virtual void draw ()
    const = 0; 
"= 0" is known as a pure specifier.

5) catch(…) statement is used to catch all types of exceptions.
A special catch block called 'catch all' catch(...) that can be used to catch all types of exceptions.
                                                          PART B
6. #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;
    class arithmetic_operators 
    {
    public:
    char op;
    float a,b;
    arithmetic_operators()
    {
      this->num2 = 0;
      this->num2 = 0;
    }
    arithmetic_operators(int a, int b)
    {
      this->num1 = a;
      this->num2 = b;
    }
    friend arithmetic_operators operator+(arithmetic_operators&, arithmetic_operators&);
    };
int main()
{
  char op;
  float num1, num2;
  cout << "Enter operator either + or - or * or /: ";
  cin >> op;
  cout << "Enter two operands: ";
  cin >> num1 >> num2;
  switch(op)
  {
    case '+':
    cout << num1+num2;
    break;

  case '-':
  cout << num1-num2;
  break;

  default:
  cout << "Error! operator is not correct";
  break;
  }
  return 0;
}
7.If derived class defines same function as defined in its base class, it is known as function overriding.It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism. It enables you to provide specific implementation of the function which is already
provided by its base class.

Program :
  #include<iostream>
  using namespace std;
  class Sports
  {
    public:
    void players()
    {
      cout << "This is parent class" << endl;
    }
  };
  class Cricket : public Sports 
  {
    public:
    void players()
    {
      cout << "Dhoni,Kohli" << endl;
    }
  };
  class Football : public Sports {
  public:
  void players()
  {
    cout << "Ronaldo,Messi" << endl;
  }
  };
  class Volleyball : public Sports {
  public:
  void players()
  {
    cout << "Gavin Schmitt,Earvin Ngapeth" << endl;
  }
  };
int main() 
{
  Cricket c;
  Football f;
  Volleyball v;
  c.players();
  f.players();
  v.players();
  return 0;
}

8) Base class constructors are always called in the derived class constructors. Whenever you create derived class object, 
first the base class default constructor is executed and then the derived class's constructor finishes execution.
1. Whether derived class's default constructor is called or parameterised is called, base class's default constructor is always
called inside them.
2. To call base class's parameterised constructor inside derived class's parameterised constructor, we must mention it explicitly
while declaring derived class's parameterized constructor.

Program:
  class Base
  {
    int x;
    public:
    Base(int i)
     {
        x = i;
        cout << "Base Parameterized Constructor\n";
      }
  };
  class Derived : public Base 
  {
    int y;
    public:
    Derived(int j):Base(j)
    {
       y = j;
       cout << "Derived Parameterized Constructor\n";
    }
  };
  int main()
  {
    Derived d(10);
  }

9)  Runtime Polymorphism:
Function overriding is an example of Runtime polymorphism.When child class declares a method, which is already present in the parent class then this is 
called function overriding, here child class overrides the parent class.This is also known as dynamic or late binding.

Program:
  #include<iostream>
  using namespace std;
  class A
  {
    public:
    void disp()
    {
      cout<<"Super Class Function"<<endl;
    }
  };
  class B:
  public A
  {
    public:
    void disp()
    {
      cout<<"Sub Class Function";
    }
  };
  int main()
  {
    A obj;
    obj.disp();
    B obj2;
    obj2.disp();
    return 0;
  }

10) #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;
    float Division ( float num, float den);
    {
      return (num / den);
    }
    int main ()
    {
      float numerator = 12.5;
      float denominator = 0;
      float result;
      result = Division (numerator, denominator);
      cout << "The quotient of 12.5/0 is"<< result << endl;
    } 
                                                                 PART C
11) Program: 
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class salary
{
    public:
    long double bp;
    void get()
    {
        cout<<"Enter basic salary\n";       
        cin>>bp;
    }
    void print()
    {
        cout<<"Basic salary="<<bp<<"\n";
    }
};
class isalary:public salary
{
    public:
    long double is;
    void get()
    {
        salary::get();
        int i;
        float pec;
        cout<<"Enter incremented percentage\n";
        cin>>i;
        pec=i*0.01;
        is=bp+pec;
    }
    void print()
    {
        cout<<"Incremented salary="<<is<<"\n";
    }
};
class rsalary:public isalary
{
    public:
    long double p,r;
    void get()
    {
        isalary::get();
        cout<<"Enter performance salary\n";         //the performance salary must be higher than the basic salary//
        cin>>p;
        r=is+p;
    }
    void print()
    {
        cout<<"Revised salary="<<r<<"\n";
    }
};
int main()
{
    rsalary obj;    //only for single user//
    obj.get();
    obj.print();
}
